Installing Dlib Library on Windows

Installing Dlib library on linux and mac operating systems is very easy and have very good documentation also but as far as windows are concerned it is quite difficult to do so.It requires downloading visual studios,cmake and then using anaconda to install the library followed by setting the environment variables. This is quite complicated. At first I tried to use this method but couldn't succeed in the same.
If you wish to follow these long steps then you can follow a blog whose link has been mentioned below.

Otherwise there is a very simple process to install the same library with just one single command through your command prompt.
If you are using python 2.7 then you can simply download the file from the list.Mention the path in the command prompt and use the following command to simply download it.

pip install dlib-file.whl

If you are using python 3.6 then again the steps are similar just the file that you have to download is different, download the dlib file for python 3.6(again mentioned in the list) and use the command mentioned above.

If anyhow you the file you have downloaded is not working or you are able to install dlib through your command prompt then try to find a suitable whl file from the following list mentioned in the link below.
